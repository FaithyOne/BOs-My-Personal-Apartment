Create and customize your own personal apartment in a separate dimension with the "My Personal Apartment" Minecraft Forge Mod.

## Description

The "My Personal Apartment" mod allows players to escape to their own private realm, where they can design and decorate their personal apartments freely. Each player gets their own unique space, and they can choose from various templates to build their dream dwelling.
Explore an interdimensional world of infinite possibilities and express your creativity like never before!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Information

This mod is still in development and not yet ready to use it in a productive environment.
It is also not recommended to use it in a world that you want to keep, as the world generation will change in the future and the world needs to be recreated.
The beta version is released to get feedback from the community and to find bugs and errors.
The release version will be released in the next few weeks.

## Spawning

The apartment dimension can be accessed by using the reception NPC which are spawning in villages.
Before you can create a new apartment you need to pay a broker fee of 64 emeralds.

## Tiers

There are 6 tiers of apartments, each with a different size, number of rooms and price.

| Tier | Size  | Price  | Description                                            | Implemented        |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| 1    | 16x16 | free   | Small empty room for free building                     | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 2    | 16x16 | 1000   | Small room with a bed and a chest and basic decoration | :construction:     |
| 3    | 16x16 | 5000   | Small room with exclusive furniture and decoration     | :construction:     |
| 4    | 32x32 | 10000  | Large empty room for free building                     | :construction:     |
| 5    | 32x32 | 50000  | Large room with a bed and a chest and basic decoration | :construction:     |
| 6    | 32x32 | 100000 | Large room with exclusive furniture and decoration     | :construction:     |

The price is currently only a placeholder and will be changed in the future.

## Commands

If you need to teleport back to the former dimension, you can use the `/my_personal_apartment back` command.
This command will teleport you back to the last position, but only if you are in the apartment dimension and if you have a valid apartment.

## Creative Items

There are some creative items available to spawn the reception NPC and to use the key-holder block.

### Reception NPC

The reception NPC can be used to create a new apartment or to teleport to an existing apartment.

### Key-Holder Block

The key-holder block can be used to access the apartment without the reception NPC. (wip)
Besides of this is mostly used as a decoration block.
