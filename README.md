Create and customize your own personal apartment in a separate dimension with the "My Personal Apartment" Minecraft Forge Mod.

## Description

The "My Personal Apartment" mod allows players to escape to their own private realm, where they can design and decorate their personal apartments freely. Each player gets their own unique space, and they can choose from various templates to build their dream dwelling.
Explore an interdimensional world of infinite possibilities and express your creativity like never before!

## Tiers

There are 6 tiers of apartments, each with a different size and number of rooms.
The higher the tier, the more rooms you can build.
